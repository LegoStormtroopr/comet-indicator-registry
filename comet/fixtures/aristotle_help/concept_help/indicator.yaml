        <p>A health indicator is a single measure that is reported on regularly
        and that provides relevant and actionable information about population
        health and/or health system performance and characteristics.
        An indicator can provide comparable information, as well as track 
        progress and performance over time.
        </p>
        <p>Health indicators support provinces/territories, regional health
        authorities and facilities as they monitor the health of their populations
        and track how well their local health systems function.

        <p>The drivers for standard development arise from the
        need for better information - whether it is statistical, administrative,
        clinical or other information. This ensures the data used in statistics
        is compatible and it facilitates National and International interoperability.
