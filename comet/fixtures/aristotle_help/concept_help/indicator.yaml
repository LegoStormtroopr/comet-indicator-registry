        <p>A health indicator is a single measure that is reported on regularly
        and that provides relevant and actionable information about population
        health and/or health system performance and characteristics.
        An indicator can provide comparable information, as well as track 
        progress and performance over time.
        </p>
        <p>Health indicators support provinces/territories, regional health
        authorities and facilities as they monitor the health of their populations
        and track how well their local health systems function.

        <p>The drivers for standard development arise from the
        need for better information - whether it is statistical, administrative,
        clinical or other information. This ensures the data used in statistics
        is compatible and it facilitates National and International interoperability.

    creation_tip: 
        <p>
        Indicators should be clearly defined and specify the [[aristotle_mdr.DataElement|s]]
        used in their calculations.
        If the resulting value type of an Indicator is known ahead of time it can
        be specified by attaching a [[aristotle_mdr.ValueDomain]] to clearly
        code the value and provides a valuable linkage to other similar indicators.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Once an indicator has been saved, numerator and denominator
        [[aristotle_mdr.DataElement|s]] as well as [[Outcome areas]] can be
        attached from the Indicator page.
